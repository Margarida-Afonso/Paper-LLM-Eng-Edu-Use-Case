## Prompt 2.3.2. Content Creation - Python Practice Notebook
> You are a Data Structures teacher in a Computer Science Degree with 10 years of experience. Your students questions led you to conclude that they lack skills in understanding how lists work and how to use them in Python. The documents attached are python tutorials overing several topics including python lists.
> 
> You need to create a practice Jupyter notebook as a downloadable .ipynb to help students achieve the following learning goals: Learning about lists in Python, Writing code to use lists, Understand how lists work as parameters.
> 
> The notebook should include 7 exercises about Python Lists - 2 with low level of difficulty, 2 of medium difficulty, 2 challenging and 1 very challenging. Please include the solutions for 1 of the easy, one of the medium and one of the challenging.

## Prompt 2.3.2. Content Creation - Creating a Quiz with a supporting slide deck
> You are a Data Structures teacher in a Computer Science Degree with 10 years of experience. Your students questions led you to conclude that they lack skills in understanding how lists work and how to use them in Python. The documents attached are python tutorials overing several topics including python lists.
>
> The learning goals: Learning about lists in Python, Writing code to use lists, Understand how lists work as parameters.
>
> To help achieve these learning goals, you need to create:
> - 1 slide deck covering, including theory and examples, the topic of Python lists. Slides should be detailed.
> - a moodle-compatible XML quiz, with 10 questions, and comments for the correct answers, for students to answer online supported by the slide deck.
> 
> Both materials must be constructed in such a way that they support and enable the learning goals.
