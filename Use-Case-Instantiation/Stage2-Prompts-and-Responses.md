## Prompt 2.3.2. Content Creation - Creating a Quiz with a supporting slide deck
> You are a Data Structures teacher in a Computer Science Degree with 10 years of experience. Your students questions led you to conclude that they lack skills in understanding how lists work and how to use them in Python. The documents attached are python tutorials overing several topics including python lists.
>
> The learning goals: Learning about lists in Python, Writing code to use lists, Understand how lists work as parameters.
>
> To help achieve these learning goals, you need to create:
> - 1 slide deck covering, including theory and examples, the topic of Python lists. Slides should be detailed.
> - a moodle-compatible XML quiz, with 10 questions, and comments for the correct answers, for students to answer online supported by the slide deck.
> 
> Both materials must be constructed in such a way that they support and enable the learning goals.

**Note:** A previous version of the prompt was attempted, include an additional requirement - d) - to include screen shots or images to ilustrate each of the step. At this point ChatGPT can not yet respond to this request, so it responded 

      "To create both Word tutorials with real screenshots, I’ll need image files illustrating the platforms.
      
      Could you please upload the following screenshots?
      
      For the YouTube Tutorial:
      ✅ YouTube homepage (showing how to access)
      ✅ Search bar on YouTube (showing how to search)
      ✅ A video URL in the browser address bar (how to access by URL)
      ✅ Save button or playlist options on a video (how to save a video)
      
      For the JupyterLite Tutorial:
      ✅ JupyterLite homepage or interface (showing how to access)
      ✅ File browser showing a notebook (how to open a notebook)
      ✅ Menu or save icon (how to save changes)
      ✅ A notebook cell running code (how to run code)
      
      You can send them as individual image files or as a zip file. Once I have them, I’ll create two complete Word tutorials with properly inserted screenshots."
